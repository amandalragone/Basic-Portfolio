            <img src="assets/images/profile_picture.jpg" alt="Amanda Lamberti Ragone's picture"/>

            <p>My name is Amanda Lamberti Ragone. I was born in S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil, but have been living in Austin, TX, since 2015.</p>
            
            <p>I have a Bachelor's in Translation and started my career as an English Teacher. After about two years of teaching, I started working as a Technical Writer for IBM, and that's when my goals and aspirations started changing. I loved working with IT and wanted that to be my future!</p>

            <p>In 2015, I moved to the United States and started working as a User Support Coordinatorfor Apple. Then, in 2018, after 8 years working on non-technical roles within huge IT companies, I decided I wanted to open my possibilities and migrate to a technical role.</p>

            <p>That's why I have just started taking Web Development classes. By the end of 2019, I hope to have sharpened my technical skills and be able to work full time as a Full Stack Developer.</p>

            <p>Besides loving to work with IT and to learn how to code, on my free time I love to read, spend time with my family and friends, go to the movies, and travel! A few curiosities about me are that I can speak 4 languages (Portuguese, English, Spanish and Italian), I love all kinds of animals (especially cats!), and I used to volunteer for a Cat Rescue in Brazil.</p>
